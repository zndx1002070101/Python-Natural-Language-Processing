# Natural Lanuage Processing

In this project, you’ll be working as a data scientist for a news analytics company interested in monitoring and analyzing news on social media platforms to look for misinformation. One of the most popular platforms is Twitter, which has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.

In this context, your company has given you a project in which they want you to build a deep learning text classification model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which aren’t. The dataset comes from Kaggle.

Data Description
You'll be using the train.csv and test.csv datasets that contain five columns:

* id: a unique identifier for each tweet

* keyword: a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)

* location: the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)

* text: the text of the tweet

* target: denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0). This is the target variable.
